OFDPA Source Files
==================
The directories under the src directory contain source files that define the 
OF-DPA API and examples illustrating how to use the API.  The contents of these
directories are described below:

 o example - a collection of client applications that accept and parse
             command line parameters to invoke the OF-DPA API. They
             illustrate how OF-DPA APIs are called.

 o include - the header files defining the OF-DPA API.

 o ofagent - a reference port of an OpenFlow Agent illustrating how the
             OF-DPA API may be interfaced with an agent library.

 o Ryu -     sample scripts and configuration files used to demonstrate a
             traffic engineering scenario using a Ryu based OpenFlow controller.
