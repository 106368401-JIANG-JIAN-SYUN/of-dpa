       How to Install OF-DPA Binary
       ----------------------------

This document describes how to install the OF-DPA software provided in
this package on the Interface Masters Niagra 2948-6XL switch.

Note: Files should be downloaded using scp or sftp.

Download and install the boardkeeper package
============================================

* download boardkeeper_1.0_amd64.deb

* install using command "dpkg -i boardkeeper_1.0_amd64.deb"

* reboot the switch (e.g., "shutdown -r now")

Downloading and running OF-DPA
==============================

* cd to target directory.

* Download the SDK kernel modules and configuration files on the switch:
  linux-kernel-bde.ko
  linux-user-bde.ko

* Download the OFDPA executables on the switch:
  ofdpa
  ofagentapp

* Ensure the executables are actually executable
  chmod 755 ofdpa
  chmod 755 ofagentapp

* Download the RPC shared libaray:
  librpc_client.so.1

* Install the RPC shared library. The destination directory to install
  the RPC shared library depends on the host environment.  Install the
  shared library in a location included in the system's library search
  path.

  # mv librpc_client.so.1 /usr/lib
  # cd /usr/lib
  # ln -sf librpc_client.so.1 librpc_client.so

* The switch is now ready to run one of the executables. Either the
  ofdpa or the ofagentapp program can be run. "cd" to the target
  directory and start either executable as a background process:

  #./ofdpa &

Or

  #./ofagentapp --controller=IP:PORT &


Downloading and running example Client Applications
===================================================
* Change to the target directory and download the following applications:
  client_acl
  client_bridging
  client_cfg_purge
  client_debugcomp
  client_debuglvl
  client_drivshell
  client_event
  client_flowtable_dump
  client_group
  client_ingress_port
  client_pkt_txrx
  client_port
  client_routing
  client_srcmac_learn
  client_termmac
  client_tunnel_ecmp_nexthop
  client_tunnel_ecmp_nexthop_member
  client_tunnel_nexthop
  client_tunnel_port
  client_tunnel_port_tenant
  client_tunnel_tenant
  client_vlan

* Ensure the applications are actually executable
  chmod 755 client_*

* All the client programs can be started from the linux shell as any standard
  linux application. Use '--help' option to display supported options.

Building Client Applications
============================

Source code for OF-DPA client applications may be built on the switch using standard
GNU development tools. The client applications are dynamically linked with the OF-DPA
shared library. Commands to compile and link one of the example client applications.
are shown below. Substitute the appropriate file names to build other client applications.

 # ! Compile step
 # gcc -c -o client_acl.o -I../include client_acl.c
 # ! Link step
 # gcc -o client_acl -Wl,-Bstatic client_acl.o -Wl,-Bdynamic -lc -lrpc_client
