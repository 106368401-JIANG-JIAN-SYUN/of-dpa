       How to Install OF-DPA
       ---------------------

This document describes how to install the OF-DPA software provided in
this package on the Celestica Redstone XP switch.

Pre-requisites:  The switch must have ICOS installed via ONIE.
    Must log in as user admin, password is broadcom.
    All commands run as root user.
    The OF-DPA service cannot be run at the same time as the ICOS service.

Downloading and running OF-DPA
==============================

* download the OF-DPA .deb package
    admin@localhost:~$ sudo bash
    root@localhost:~# tftp 10.27.64.25
    tftp> bin
    tftp> get ofdpa/im/ofdpa-redstone-xp_0.E.2.0.0_amd64.deb
    tftp> quit

* Install the OF-DPA .deb package
    root@localhost:~# dpkg -i ofdpa-redstone-xp_0.E.2.0.0_amd64.deb

    Note:  It may be necessary to run the following command before installing
           OF-DPA because sometimes the ONIE install leaves some packages
           in a half-configured state:

           dpkg --configure -a

* The switch is now ready to run one of the services. Either the
  ofdpa or the ofagentapp service can be run.  If the ICOS service
  is running, it must be stopped first.

    root@localhost:~# stop icos


    root@localhost:~# start ofdpa
    root@localhost:~# status ofdpa
    root@localhost:~# stop ofdpa

  or

    root@localhost:~# start ofagentapp
    root@localhost:~# status ofagentapp
    root@localhost:~# stop ofagentapp

* Configuring command line parameters for OF-DPA (or ofagentapp):
    Edit /etc/default/ofdpa (or /etc/default/ofagentapp) and set the
    OFARGS parameter For example, to set the debugging level to 2:
    OFARGS=--debuglvl=2

* Log files can be found here:
    /var/log/upstart/ofdpa.log
    /var/log/upstart/ofagentapp.log


Running example Client Applications
===================================================
* Client applications are installed in /broadcom/ofdpa

* All the client programs can be started from the linux shell as any standard
  linux application. Use '--help' option to display supported options.

Building Client Applications
============================

Source code for OF-DPA client applications may be built on the switch using standard
GNU development tools. The client applications are dynamically linked with the OF-DPA
shared library. Commands to compile and link one of the example client applications
are shown below. Substitute the appropriate file names to build other client applications.

 # ! Compile step
 # gcc -c -o client_acl.o -I../include client_acl.c
 # ! Link step
 # gcc -o client_acl -Wl,-Bstatic client_acl.o -Wl,-Bdynamic -lc -lrpc_client
