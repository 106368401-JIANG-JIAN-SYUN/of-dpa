OF-DPA 1.0 Release Notes
========================

Following are the known issues in this release:

FP-192796
On modifiying the physical port number in tunnel next hop flow, packets other than the expected ones are also received on VTEP.

FP-192368
Tunnelled traffic with incrementing source mac does not hash between the next hops of an ECMP next hop group. 

FP-185121
VXLAN encapsulated packets do not egress with new destination multicast address after modification of the tunnel next-hop.

FP-185080
A DLF Tenant Bridging flow is a no-op since forwarding happens right after configuring the tenant tunnel and the overlay group. The bridging flow is not required.

FP-184285
Traffic is not distributed according to the configured min and max rates to the queues on an egress port.

FP-184170
Received packets counter is not incrementing if the received packet frame size is > 64 bytes.

FP-183886
Get and clear port queue stats fails on TD+.

FP-183818
Able to configure invalid values for port advertising feature.

FP-204333
This is a documentation issue. Due to operation of the switching silicon, entries in the Termination MAC flow table are constrained such that multiple entries 
matching on the same data for IN_PORT, ETH_DST, and VLAN_VID and different data for ETH_TYPE must specify the same values for  Priority and specify the same 
Action for Goto-table (i.e. using next table of 0 to indicate the matching packets should be dropped) and Output CONTROLLER (i.e. copy to CPU). This behavior 
will be documented in the programmers' guidance for future releases. This behavior happens on all supported platforms.
